                    He’s rocking a timeless sense of style.
                    From the simplest look to the sparkliest of suits, Mickey Mouse has a style for the ages. Of course, we adore his red shorts and yellow shoes, but we can’t forget his iconic looks like his sorcerer’s hat, his band uniform, and even his disco jumpsuit! And be sure to stop by Disney theme parks to see Mickey dressed for any occasion, whether it be a safari hat for Animal Kingdom, a newsboy suit for dancing around Buena Vista Street at Disney California Adventure, or bundled up in his coziest clothes for the parks’ holiday celebrations! Fashionistas, take note, because Mickey has miles of styles!

                One can't but help loving these cartoon characters. These characters also bought fame and prosperity to Walt Disney and company. Most importantly they represent the values that this company strives for to keep people happy.

                    He’s the symbol of our childhood.
                    Whether you were born when Mickey premiered or just last year, everyone has fond childhood memories of Mickey. He’s the quintessential symbol of childhood, entertaining us in his cartoons and welcoming our families to his theme parks, and even inspiring us to use our imaginations and follow our dreams! Whenever we see Mickey, we remember how it feels to be a kid, since like Walt Disney once said, “Adults are only kids grown up, anyway.”

                    He’s full of boundless imagination.
                    When we think of Disney, we think of creativity and storytelling and adventures in far-off lands. Mickey Mouse embodies that creative spirit with his boundless imagination. As the star of Disneyland and Disney Hollywood Studios’ show Fantasmic!, Mickey uses his boundless imagination to fight off a rogue’s gallery of Disney villains, culminating in a battle of imaginations between himself and Maleficent, now transformed into a dragon. With an imagination that bold and beautiful, it’s no wonder that Mickey symbolizes the creativity of Disney.

                    He’s a mouse-ter of all trades.
                    One of the many perks of starring in countless cartoons is lots of work experience—just ask Mickey! He’s driven a boat, flown a plane, hunted ghosts, cleaned clocks, and even ruled as a king! And, of course, he’s the welcoming host at Disney theme parks all over the world and the leader of the Mickey Mouse Club, too! You’d wonder how Mickey can do it all, but don’t forget, he’s been learning magic, too!
